# EgoDrive: An Egocentric, Multimodal Dataset and Methods for Driver Behavior Analysis

EgoDrive: Multimodal Driver Behavior Recognition using Project Aria

## 🚗 Overview

EgoDrive is the first egocentric, multimodal dataset for driver behavior analysis captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses. This proof-of-concept work demonstrates the technical feasibility of real-time driver behavior recognition through multimodal sensor fusion, combining RGB video, eye gaze tracking, hand pose estimation, IMU data, and semantic object detection.

**Key Features:**

- 🎥 **138,024 frames** of synchronized multimodal data (2.5 hours)
- 👁️ **Six behavioral classes**: Driving, Left/Right/Rear Mirror Check, Mobile Phone Usage, Idle
- ⚡ **Real-time performance**: Sub-3ms inference with 97.4% accuracy
- 🔬 **Proof-of-concept validation** for multimodal egocentric driver monitoring
- 🏗️ **Two model variants**: EgoDriveMax (accuracy-focused) and EgoDriveRT (efficiency-focused)

## 🔍 Technical Contributions

## 🤖 Model Architecture

We developed two variants of our Multimodal Transformer architecture:

| ----------- | ------ | ----- | ----------- | --- | ------ | -------------- | -------- |
| EgoDriveMax | 2      | 4     | 256         | ✓   | 42M    | 1595ms         | 98.6%    |
| EgoDriveRT  | 1      | 2     | 32          | ✗   | 104K   | 2.65ms         | 97.4%    |

### Architecture Components:

- **RGB Encoder**: Swin-Tiny + ResNet-18 motion stream

## ⚠️ Limitations and Scope

This work presents a proof-of-concept study with the following limitations:

- **Single Participant**: Dataset collected from one driver in controlled conditions
- **Limited Generalizability**: Results may not extend to diverse populations
- **Controlled Environment**: Laboratory-style data collection setup
- **Scope**: Technical feasibility demonstration rather than production system

**Future Work**: Multi-participant validation, real-world testing, and privacy-preserving deployment strategies.
